## Introduction
Geofencing will restrict PokeAlarm alerts to a defined geographical area.
The area is defined by a list of at least 2 sets of latitude and longitude
coordinates.  You may provide as many coordinates as you'd like to define
your area of interest, provided that these sets are in the order that
defines your polygon.

**Note:** PokeAlarm will first check pokemon alert distance, *then* will
check to see if the pokemon is located within your geofence.
See [Filters](monster-filters#parameters) on how to limit alerts
based on distance.

## Instructions

Create a text file with with a series of at least 3 *latitude,longitude*
sets and place this in the same folder as `start_pokealarm.py`.
(A minimum of 3 points are required as of PokeAlarm v3.1.)

**To define a rectangular geofence:**  Use 2 lat/lon sets, with the first
set defining the top left of the rectangle, and the second defining the
bottom right of the rectangle.

**To define a polygonal geofence:** Provide as many lat/lon sets as it
takes to define your polygon. Make sure that you provide the points
**in order** to describe the polygon.

Execute `start_pokealarm.py` with the `-gf` or `--geofences` flag,
along with the path to your geofence file, or add
`geofence:YOUR_GEOFENCE_FILE` to `config.ini`.

## Example: 4 point geofence - Central Park, New York, NY

The text file below defines the northwest, southwest, southeast and
northeast corners of central park. The heading in brackets
`[NAME_OF_GEOFENCE]` is mandatory, and PokeAlarm will fail if not
included in the geofence file.

file: `central-park-geofence.txt`
```
[Central Park, NY]
40.801206,-73.958520
40.767827,-73.982835
40.763798,-73.972808
40.797343,-73.948385
```

In the image above, each numbered marker 1-4 represents the lat,lon
coordinates found in central-park-geofence.txt, respectively.

To run PokeAlarm with geofencing enabled, execute:

`python start_pokealarm.py -gf central-park-geofence.txt`

or

`python start_pokealarm.py --geofences central-park-geofence.txt`

or you can include `geofences:central-park-geofence.txt` in your
`config.ini` file.

If successful, you should receive a confirmation in your log:

```
2018-01-20 18:05:26 [  Geofence][    INFO] Geofence Central Park, NY added!
```

For our Central Park example, all 4 points encompass the entire park.
The visual of the geofenced area is below.
The red marker in the image denotes a selected location, here,
"The Pond, Central Park, NY".

![](../images/geofence_central_park_bounded.png)

PokeAlarm will then notify you of pokemon within the shaded area.

**Note:** Remember to configure the filters to use this area of ​​the geofence
or will not apply to alerts. Example:

```
"filter_tiny_central_park": {
    "geofences": [ "Central Park, NY" ]
}
```

## Example: 21 point geofence - Coronado Island, San Diego, CA

You may add as many lat,lon points to define you polygon, provided that the
points in your geofence file are in order of defining said polygon. Below is
an example of a 21 point polygon encompassing an area.

file: `geofence_coronado.txt`
```

```

And remember to set filters to apply geofence like this example:

```
"filter_coronado": {
    "geofences": [ "Coronado, CA" ]
}
```

Below is the resulting geofence:

## Example: Multiple Geofences in the same `geofences.txt` file

You are permitted to add more than one geofence area in a single
`geofences.txt` file. Add a bracketed header before each set of
coordinates. For example:

```
[Central Park, NY]
40.801206,-73.958520
40.767827,-73.982835
40.763798,-73.972808

32.711983226476136,-117.18704223632812
```

In this example, you can configure an individual alarm to only check one
geofence from your geofence.txt. This filter will only check the geofence
named "Central Park, NY:

```
"filter_central_park": {
    "geofences": [ "Central Park, NY" ]
}
```

Or check the 2 geofence zones with:

```
"filter_central_park_coronado": {
    "geofences": [ "Central Park, NY", "Coronado, CA" ]
}
```

Additionally, you can use "geofences": [ "all" ] as a shortcut for checking
all geofences in a geofence file. Example:

```
"filter_all_geofences": {
    "geofences": [ "all" ]
}
```

## Geofence Generator: Draw Your Own Geofence
These are handy web tool to create and visualize your desired geofence.

Jason's [A Better Fence Editor](http://geo.jasparke.net/) - Recommended by PokeAlarm team

To use it:
1. Create a fence name, color and click Create. (If you have a fence already
paste it into the Coordinate Set)
2. Click for each geofence point until you have made made a full circle.
3. Click exp (Export) from there you can copy, paste or click Download with
or without fence name tag.
4. To better manage all your geofences in one file you can save a json file
that saves everything as you have it.
5. Click load to load previously generated geofences and continue.

JennerPalacios's Codepen [Geofence Generator](https://codepen.io/jennerpalacios/full/mWWVeJ)

To use it:
1. Type your desired location.
2. Click for each geofence point that you would like to add to the
coordinate list.
3. Complete your geofence area by clicking the original point, the last
point, or double clicking.
4. Click "Show Coordinates", Assign a name - ie: [Seattle] and then
click "Copy to Clipboard"
