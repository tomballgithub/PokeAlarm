## Prerequisites
This guide assumes the following:

1. You have correctly [installed PokeAlarm](installation).

2. You are using Notepad++, Nano, or Vi(m) to configure any files. Do **NOT**
use or open any files with Notepad or TextEdit - they will break your files!

## Introduction
In PokeAlarm, a **Manager** is a grouping of different settings. Managers
allow you to configure multiple combinations of filters, alarms, geofences,
and other settings behind single webserver

![Manager Example](../images/v3_overview.png)

Webhooks are received by the PokeAlarm server, which then passes a copy to
the manager. Each Manager determines (independently)if the alert passes one
of the set filters (and geofence if enabled). If it does, the Manager sends
the alert to the alarm defined in the Alarms file.

PokeAlarm runs each Manager in a separate process, allowing each Manager to
operate in parallel and taking advantage of multiple cores.

## Multiple Managers

 Managers can be configured using either the command line or the configuration
 file. In order to run multiple managers, you must first set `manager_count`
 equal to the number of mangers you want to run. Managers use the arguments of
 a type in order. If only one argument (of a type) is provided, this argument
 will be applied to all Managers. For example, the following command:
 ```
 python start_pokealarm.py -m 3 -f common.json -f rares.json -f uncommon.json -a alarms.json
 ```  
 This command sets up three managers. The first uses the filter file
 `common.json`, the second uses the `rares.json`, and the third uses the
 `uncommon.json`. However, all three managers will use the same `alarms.json`
 file to set up their alarms.

 This same configuration can be accomplished via the following in the
 configuration file:

 ```ini
manager_count: 1

filters: [ common.json, rares.json, uncommon.json ]
alarms: alarms.json
```

## Additional Options

### Manager Names

Manager names are currently useful for logging purposes only. Changing the
name will change the name of the logger used in PA's output. Manager names
are configured the same as other parameters:

```ini
manager_name: [ manager_0, manager_1, manager_2 ]
```

If no manager name is defined, PA will name that manager automatically based
on it's order.

### Geofences

Geofences are a useful tool and can be bound in a mixture of combinations to
different Managers. Configuring geofence files is similar to other options:

```ini
geofence: [ city1.json, none, city2.json ]
```

As you can see, you can mix managers with geofences and without by using
`none` for any managers that you don't want a geofence file loaded for.

You can find more information about Geofences on the [Geofences](geofences)
wiki page.

### Timezones

By default PA will use your server time for notifications. If you wish to
change this timezone, you can use either the `-tz` or `--timezone` to set a
timezone. A full list of compatible timezones can be found  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
